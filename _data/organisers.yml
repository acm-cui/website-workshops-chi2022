    is an Assistant Professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology at the 
    department of Industrial Design, with a background in philosophy, digital 
    arts, and HCI. Her research is about morally relevant interactions with 
    technological agents like robots or chatbots. Her work explores how we can 
    explore our moral self-identity through conversations with digital entities, 
    e.g., via acting compassionately towards a chatbot. She has organized 
    workshops at relevant conferences: CSCW '20--'21, IUI '21, HRI '2021, and 
    Philosophy of Human-Technology Relations (PHTR) '20.

    is a graduate student at the Technologies for Aging Gracefully Lab and the 
    Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto. Her research focuses on 
    the inclusive design of conversational interfaces for underrepresented users 
    like older adults. She has been a co-organizer of the CUI conference series 
    and related workshops at CHI '19--'21, IUI '20--'21, and CSCW ’20.

    is a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Research Fellow and a PhD candidate at the 
    school of Psychology and Neuroscience of the University of Glasgow. Guy is 
    interested with the neuropsychological mechanisms that underlay human–robot 
    interactions, and the affect of these interactions. Guy's research is aimed 
    at exploring how people disclose their emotions and needs to social robots, 
    and how these, in turn, can reduce stress and burden.

    is a Lecturer in Human-Computer Interaction at the Computational Foundry 
    in Swansea University. His research examines the effects of voice and 
    language design on speech interface interactions and how linguistic 
    theories can be implemented and redefined in this context. He is co-founder 
    of the international Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) conference series.

    is a Lecturer in the Computational Foundry at Swansea University. His work 
    examines the use of new technologies such as conversational interfaces in 
    multi-party settings like pubs and the home. He has recently co-organised 
    workshops at CHI '18–'21 and CSCW '16, '17 and '20 on topics including 
    collocated interaction with technologies and conversational user 
    interfaces. He is a member of the CUI conference series steering committee.

    is an Associate Professor at University College Dublin’s School of 
    Information & Communication Studies. His research lies at the juncture 
    between psychology, HCI and computer science in investigating how 
    theoretical perspectives in human communication can be applied to 
    understand phenomena in speech based human-machine communication. He has 
    published widely on user centered issues in conversational and speech 
    interface interaction, is co-founder of the international Conversational 
    User Interfaces (CUI) conference series and has been involved in a number 
    of workshops on this topic at CHI and Mobile HCI.
