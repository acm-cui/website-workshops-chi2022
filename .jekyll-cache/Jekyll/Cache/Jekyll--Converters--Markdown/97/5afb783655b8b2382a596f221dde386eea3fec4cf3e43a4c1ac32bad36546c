    <p><a href="https://minha-lee.github.io/" title="Visit Minha Lee's website">Minha Lee</a> is an Assistant Professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology at the  department of Industrial Design, with a background in philosophy, digital  arts, and HCI. Her research is about morally relevant interactions with  technological agents like robots or chatbots. Her work explores how we can  explore our moral self-identity through conversations with digital entities,  e.g., via acting compassionately towards a chatbot. She has organized  workshops at relevant conferences: CSCW '20--'21, IUI '21, HRI '2021, and  Philosophy of Human-Technology Relations (PHTR) '20. </p>
